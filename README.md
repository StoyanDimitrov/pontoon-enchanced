# Pontoon Enhanced
This is an add-on for Firefox that adds some features that Pontoon is currently missing until they are covered by the core team.

## What Hacks are Included?
Currently there is only one.

### The Translation Items Counter
It adds the number of the currently loaded entities after the magnifier glass in the search field.

**Note:** This number is only of the *currently loaded in the scrollback* items and **not** *all available by the currently applied filter* if any filters are applied.

## Install
The signed add-on file can be [downloaded here](pontoon-enchanced/blob/bin/pontoon_enhanced-0.0.2-fx.xpi).
