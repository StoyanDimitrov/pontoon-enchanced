# Pontoon Enhanced
This is a browser extension that adds some features that Pontoon is currently missing until they are covered by the core team.

## What Hacks are Included?
Two simple ones. You can read more about them below.

### The Translation Items Counter
It adds the number of the currently loaded entities after the magnifier glass in the search field.

**Note:** This number is only of the *currently loaded in the scroll-back* items and **not** *all available by the currently applied filter* if any filters are applied.

### Select Single Word Translations
This selects (on focus) the content of the text field if there is a string of characters without space in between them.
