# Pontoon Enhanced
This is an add-on for Firefox that adds some features that Pontoon is currently missing until they are covered by the core team.

## What Hacks are Included?
Currently there is only one.

### The Translation Items Counter
It adds the number of the currently loaded entities after the magnifier glass in the search field.

**Note:** This number is only of the *currently loaded in the scrollback* items and **not** *all available by the currently applied filter* if any filters are applied.

### Select Single Word Translations
This selects (on focus and click) the content of the text field if there is a string of characters without space inbetween them.

**Note:** Does not react to jQ focus event so it does not select the initial value when selected from the list.

## Install
The signed add-on file can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/StoyanDimitrov/pontoon-enchanced/raw/bin/pontoon_enhanced-0.0.3-fx.xpi).
